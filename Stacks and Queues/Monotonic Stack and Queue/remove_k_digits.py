    take example of '123456789' we have to remove 3 digits which one should we remove -> 789
    take example of '987654321' we have to remove 3 digits which one should we remove -> 987
    so we need to maintain a monotonic inc stack and and whenever we find a number that is
    smaller than st[-1] we will pop that number

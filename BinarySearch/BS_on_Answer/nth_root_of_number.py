'''
here also we will use same approach as finding square root of a number problem, just we will use
binary exponentiation to find A^B 
'''

# this method might give TLE because suppose we need to find (10th root of 10^9) then mid = 5*(10^8) now
# calculating it power mid ^ 10 will be unnecesary and will give TLE
class Solution:
    # calculating A^B using binary exponentiation which have TC -> O(log(b))
    '''
    suppose we have to calculate A^B, this can be running a loop B times or we can use
    binary exponentiation method and get the result in log(B)
    Ex - 3^5, 5 => 101 (5 in binary)
    we will use two variables, one result var, and other some dummy var which will store the
    dummy value 3^(2^i) where i is the index binary_rep_of_5 so it will be like 3^1 -> 3^2 -> 3^4

    we will use this dummy value to calculate result

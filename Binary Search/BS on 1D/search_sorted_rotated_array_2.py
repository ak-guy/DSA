'''
same as search in sorted rotated array 1 but we need to handle duplicate values,
duplicate will create issue when we cannot know which side is sorted we can take example of
arr =[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1]
in this, for first iteration we cannot know which side is sorted, so to handle such case
we can checking if arr[l] == arr[m] and arr[m] == arr[r] then we will move l+=1 and r-=1
